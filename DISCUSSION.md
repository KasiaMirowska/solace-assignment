## Logical next steps if this was a ticket

High Priority
**Fixing numeric search behavior**, as I was wrapping up I realized the years of experience search does not work as expected
**Split AdvocatesList, Pagination, and AdvocateRow into reusable components.**, for maintainability and reusability
**Input validation**, type check for query params
**Loading UI improvements and error handling**, add skeleton rows for nicer UX, add error handling
**Accesibility enhancements**
**Full test coverage**

Medium Priority
**Improve the table UI**
**Specialty truncation + hover card** for nicer UX
**Sorting support (e.g., by name or city)**,

Low Priority
**Persisting filters/search in localStorage or URL state**, for sharing the search results and to provide intuitive UX on page refresh
**Caching results**
